# MIRRORLab
My work over the summer (and continuing) at the MIRRORLab in Colorado School of Mines. I developed statistical models of politeness using machine learning algorithms to allow our lab to predict when robots should use different politeness strategies, enabling robots to understand, generate, and encourage language that conforms with sociocultural linguistic norms.
